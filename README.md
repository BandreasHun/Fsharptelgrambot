# TelegramBot

**Real-time ‚Äúalpha call‚Äù tracker, built in F#.**

WepeBot is a Telegram bot that automates tracking of new token listings (‚Äúalpha calls‚Äù), fetching live price data from Dexscreener and surfacing percentage changes directly in your group chat. It was created to save manual lookups and give the Wepe alpha group instant alerts. Once the exam period is over, I will collaborate with another developer to extend its features even further.

## How It Works

1. **/addalphacall**

   * Sends your description to OpenAI to extract the contract address (CA) and chain name.
   * Queries Dexscreener for token metadata and price, then stores the call.
2. **/getalpha**

   * Fetches the latest price for each saved call, calculates Œî%, and posts results.
3. **/removecall & /changestart**

   * Manage your saved calls by index.
4. **Periodic Updates**

   * `/start` and `/interval` spin up a background loop that posts updates to the chat every *n* minutes.
5. **State Persistence**

   * Calls are serialized to `state.json` on disk and reloaded on bot startup.
