WepeBot
Real-time ‚Äúalpha call‚Äù tracker for the Wepe community (‚âà1200 members), built in F#.

WepeBot is a Telegram bot that automates tracking of new token listings (‚Äúalpha calls‚Äù), fetching live price data from Dexscreener and surfacing percentage changes directly in your group chat. It was created to save manual lookups and give the Wepe alpha group instant alerts. Once the exam period is over, I will collaborate with another developer to extend its features even further.

Live Demo
Join our public Telegram group to see WepeBot in action (admin rights required):

Features
Add New Alpha Calls
Extracts contract address and chain automatically via OpenAI API.

Live Price Updates
Queries Dexscreener for up to 300 requests/minute.

List & Stats
Shows current vs. start price and Œî% change.

Remove & Edit
/removecall <index> and /changestart <index> <price>.

Automated Loop
/start begins periodic postings; /interval <minutes> adjusts frequency; /stop ends the loop.

Admin-Only Access
Only group admins can manage calls.

Persistence
Saves state in state.json and reloads on startup.

Commands & Usage
All commands must be issued by a Telegram group admin.

Command	Description
/addalphacall <description>	Extracts CA & chain, fetches token info, and adds a new alpha call.
/getalpha	Lists all tracked calls with live price, start price, and percentage change.
/removecall <index>	Removes the alpha call at the given index.
/changestart <index> <price>	Updates the start price for the specified call.
/start	Starts the periodic update loop.
/interval <minutes>	Sets loop interval in minutes.
/stop	Stops the periodic update loop.

How It Works
/addalphacall

Sends your description to OpenAI to extract the contract address (CA) and chain name.

Queries Dexscreener for token metadata and price, then stores the call.

/getalpha

Fetches the latest price for each saved call, calculates Œî%, and posts results.

/removecall & /changestart

Manage your saved calls by index.

Periodic Updates

/start and /interval spin up a background loop that posts updates to the chat every n minutes.

State Persistence

Calls are serialized to state.json on disk and reloaded on bot startup.
